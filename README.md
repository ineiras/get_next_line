The **get_next_line** function works by reading a buffer of a specified size from the file descriptor and storing the data in a static variable. This allows the function to remember the position in the file between successive calls. The function then searches for a newline character (\n) in the stored data. If a newline is found, it returns the line up to that point. If not, it continues reading from the file descriptor until a newline is found or the end of the file is reached.

**Key Features:**

**Static Variable:** The function uses a static variable to store the remaining data between calls, ensuring that it can continue reading from where it left off.

**Buffer Size:** The function reads data in chunks defined by a buffer size (BUFFER_SIZE). This can be adjusted to optimize performance based on the use case.

**Memory Management:** The function dynamically allocates memory for each line and frees it when the line is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.
